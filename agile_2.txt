compare between agile and waterfall models  advantage, disadvantage, when to use it, best practice of both

1)agile

Advantages:

High flexibility and adaptability to change

Continuous customer involvement and feedback

Faster delivery of working software increments

Improved team collaboration and communication

Suitable for projects with evolving requirements and uncertainty

Disadvantages:

Requires high customer involvement and commitment

Can be difficult to manage large, complex projects

Less predictable project timeline and budget

Requires experienced and self-organising teams

Risk of scope creep if not managed effectively


2) waterfall
Advantages:

Clear, fixed requirements upfront

Simple to understand and manage

Well-suited for projects with stable requirements and fixed scope

Extensive documentation facilitates knowledge transfer

Project timeline and budget are precisely estimated

Disadvantages:

Inflexible to change once a phase is complete

High risk if initial requirements are incorrect

Long delivery cycles can delay feedback

Limited customer involvement throughout the project

Not suitable for projects with evolving requirements

Waterfall: when it use

Projects with well-defined, stable requirements

Fixed scope, budget, and timeline

Projects where changes are costly or impossible

Highly regulated industries with strict compliance requirements

Projects involving large development teams

Agile: when it use

Projects with evolving or uncertain requirements

Need for rapid iteration and feedback

Projects where customer involvement is essential

Smaller, cross-functional teams

Innovation-driven projects


Waterfall: Best Practices

Comprehensive requirements gathering and documentation

Rigorous change management process

Detailed project planning and scheduling

Quality assurance at each phase

Formal sign-off at each stage before proceeding

Agile: Best Practices

Prioritise and refine the product backlog continuously

Conduct regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews

Embrace continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)

Foster a collaborative and self-organising team culture

Use retrospectives to continuously improve processes
